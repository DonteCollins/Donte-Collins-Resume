        <p><em>Donte Collins</em>--A sophomore from AoIT in Brooklyn--has no worries for grades; he goes to the computer room during 6th period not to study, but to play games. Surely, he must be getting attention, but he never does.</p>
        <p>Let's be honest, people were born to make money <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_Blank">(at least in 2018)</a>, but everyone's life would be much easier if only they focus on other things, and <em>Donte Collins</em>, a soon to be entreprenur, is one of them.</p>

        <p>You wake up in bed, realize it's 9 P.M., rush to work, and forget about your co-workers. It's time you come up with a good schedule, because you NEED to meet <em>Donte Collins</em> and give him lots of money.</p>
        <p>A guy from some college in the U.S. talks about the impacts <em>Donte Collins</em> has made on society. "He is ignored everyday, people do not appreciate him, give him money, or a brand new $1,200 gaming laptop" says that guy. "It's sad how selfish people are these days, they just place unfunny gifs on anything and think they can just attract teenage consumers (and their money).</p>
        <h2>Hire Ex-president Donte Collins</h2>
        <p>He's the best person in 2018 because he is intelligent, smart, and hates movies. He will make himself more money than you because he wants you to succeed in stuff.</p>
